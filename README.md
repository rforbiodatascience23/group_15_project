## Description:

Diabetes Mellitus is a chronic disease that occurs either when the pancreas fails to produce sufficient amount of insulin or when the body cannot effectively utilize the insulin it generates. It is characterized by elevated levels of blood glucose, leading to progressive damage to critical organs such as the heart, blood vessels, eyes, nerves and kidneys. Globally, more than 422 million people have diabetes and 1.5 million deaths each year are directly attributed to diabetes. Access to affordable treatment, particularly insulin, is crucial for the survival of the people living with diabetes [1].

Diabetic nephropathy, a severe complication of diabetes, involves injury to the blood vessels in the kidneys. Increased excretion of albumin in the urine, along with elevated levels of blood urea nitrogen and creatinine, serves as signs of diabetic kidney disease.

## Data

The data used in this project were gathered from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES), a program dedicated to evaluating the health and nutritional status of adults and children in the United States.

The data set contains 6795 observations from participants in the survey, with 20 different variables. These variables includes essential demographic information such as age, race, income. Additionally, anthropometric measurements including height, weight, head circumference, body mass index (BMI) along with waist, hip and limb circumferences as well as skinfold thickness. Lasty, they included the diagnosis of diabetes/pre-diabetes as well as measurement of different biomarkers such as glycohemoglobin, albumin, blood urea nitrogen and creatinine.

The NHANES data set available to the public from the repository of the Department of Biostatistics at the Vanderbilt University <https://hbiostat.org/data/repo/nhgh.tsv>

## Goal
This project aims to see if there is a correlation between the biomarkers/measurements and diabetes diagnosis. Furthermore we investigate if, by taking medication, diagnosed patients regain the same values as non-diagnosed. 
In a broader perspective, we aim to investigate whether some income classes are more prone to having diabetes, and if the income class influences whether a person with diabetes will take medication or not.



## Usage
The data analysis result will be presented by running the script titled "R/00_all.qmd".
